Assignment 3.  Week 3 Path Analysis and Friends

----------------------------

Problem 3 below is an "enrichment" item, and you may want
to look at the solution when posted, addressing the student 
questions about latent variable models, e.g., How does structural 
equation model (latent vars) methods provide a correction for 
measurement error?

Causal Models of Publishing Productivity

This Homework 3 problem considers one of the path
analysis models from "Causal Models of Publishing
Productivity in Psychology", Rogers & Maranto,
J. Applied Psychology, 1989, 74(4), 636-649.

The path analysis conducted by the authors
from a sample of 86 men and 76 women is shown
in p.101 of Freedman's text and on page 647
of the publication; that page also exists at
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~rag/stat209/pathpage647.pdf

All the problem asks you to do is look at and consider the usefulness
of this analysis.

The diagram provides estimates of supposed causal effects ("causal
model of publishing" is the article); it displays regression coeffs
, with coefficient estimates shown on the edges.  
Consider a "productive
researcher" to be defined in terms of the number of publications and the
number of cites.  The good news is that ability "affects" pubs and cites with
a positive coefficient in each case.  Therefore, higher ability leads to a
more "productive researcher", according to the causal path gospel.
Some bad news is that sex is a predictor of pubs with a large coefficient
value.  However, it is likely that there are confounding variables between
sex and pubs.

ENRICHMENT ITEM, Structural Equation Models

Problem 3
Method-of-moments for two-variable, two-indicator model

For the Structural Equation Models handout from Joreskog
book, obtain parameter estimates for the no-correlated error 
version (9 parameters, top covariance matrix) in terms of the 
sample variance and covariances among the four indicators (y_ij).
Brute force substitution will get you a non-optimal estimate,
suffices for instructional purposes.

solution gives a nicely formatted solution
