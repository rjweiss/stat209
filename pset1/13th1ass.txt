Solutions for these problems are to be submitted in hard-copy 
form, in class 2/14/13.  Given that these problems are untimed, some care 
should be taken in presentation, clarity, format. Especially 
important is to give full and clear answers to questions, not

Problem 1. 
Observational Studies, associations

Can you handle the stress?

An observational study with survey questionnaire data from 373 subjects,
undergrads in introductory psychology classes (of course), was shown as
Example C in the week 3 path analysis introduction handouts:

Life events, fitness, hardiness, and health: A simultaneous analysis of proposed 
stress-resistance effects.
Roth, David L.; Wiebe, Deborah J.; Fillingim, Roger B.; Shay, Kathleen A.
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 57(1), Jul 1989, 136-142.

 which you can find at http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/57/1/136.pdf
but you don't need anything more than the handout excerpt for this task
(which was taken from Kline's structural equation models text).

Let's consider the three endogenous variables in the path diagram taken
from Kline's text. Data on 373 subjects measured by
"Illness" from the Seriousness of Illness rating Scale
"Stress" stressful life experiences from the Life Experiences Survey
"Fitness" from a Fitness Questionnaire

You are given correlations and standard deviations.

One obvious question is whether "fitness" may be at least protective 
against "illness", and the correlation of -.29 from this sample at least 
says that those that have higher levels of fitness tend to (at least weakly)
have lower levels of reported illness.

part a. spurious correlation?
One way to look at this is to ask whether the correlation between
fitness and illness is "spurious" in the sense that stress may 
decrease fitness (too depressed to go to the gym) and increase illness.
Construct a measure and significance test (approximate is fine) for the 
spurious correlation hypothesis.

part b.
Let us instead treat "stress" as a possible mediator variable in the relation
between "fitness" and "illness". Use the standard mediator variable
methods (credited to Barron-Kenny) to estimate the mediation effect 
(point estimate, standard error, asymptotic significance test) of stress.
Do this for both the standardized and unstandardized metrics.

part c. 
Consider the effects of errors of measurement on the your results. If
you were told (from high above) that the fitness measure has 
reliability .8 and that the stress measure has reliability .7 ,
repeat the calculations in part b for the standardized metric.
Compare these results with what you found in part b.

Problem 2.
Potential Outcomes, Encouragement designs


part 1
Start out with the salt example from week 2 lecture. 
Feasibility and efficacy of sodium reduction in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, phase I
Trials of Hypertension Prevention Collaborative Research Group.
S K Kumanyika, P R Hebert, J A Cutler, V I Lasser, C P Sugars, L Steffen-Batey, A A Brewer, MI. 
Hypertension doi: 10.1161/01.HYP.22.4.5021993;22:502-512
http://hyper.ahajournals.org.laneproxy.stanford.edu/content/22/4/502.full.pdf+html

Publication tables  give you the numbers you need on the results for this encouragement design: 
Table 3 and  Table 5 (repeated approximately in the abstract). 
Subjects are randomly assigned to intervention or control(327, 417) and Table 3 shows you 
these are approximately equivalent at baseline. "Active"
(treatment) subjects are encouraged to reduce dietary sodium intake (assessed by sodium excretion). 
Outcome (measured 18 months after intervention initiated) we will use is systolic blood pressure 
(salt is supposed to be bad for blood pressure) with the results in Table 5.  

Questions:
From the results in Table 3 (use 18-month change from baseline) and Table 5 (use 18-month systolic)
estimate the dose-response relation for decrease in systolic blood pressure for each unit
decrease in salt intake (as measured by sodium excretion). What strong assumption did you need to
make to justify this estimator? Briefly justify that assumption for this study?
-----------------------------

part 2
The immigration debate is in the news.....

In what we will treat as an encouragement design, Brader et al. (2008) conducted a randomized experiment 
where subjects are exposed to different media stories about immigration, and the authors investigated how 
their framing (i.e. the spin and tone of the stories) influences attitudes and political behavior regarding 
immigration policy. In this example, the treatment is expected to increase the level of respondents' 
emotional response, which in turn is hypothesized to make subjects more likely to send a letter to his or
her member of Congress. The response variable we will look at here is measure of anxiety (emo) which is 
influenced by the framing treatment (treat) The outcome variable is a binary variable indicating whether or 
not the participant agreed to send a letter about immigration policy to his or her member of Congress (cong_mesg)

Brader T, Valentino NA, Suhat E (2008). What Triggers Public Opposition to Immigration?

959-978.
jstor link  http://www.jstor.org/stable/25193860?origin=JSTOR-pdf


The vignette for the mediation package linked in week 2 has data "framing"
for this encouragement design.
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediation/vignettes/mediation.pdf
So you need to get the framing data from the mediation package

Variables we will use in this exercise are

cong_mesg:     Whether subjects requested sending an anti-immigration message to Congress on their behalf.
treat:   Product of the two treatment variables. In the original study the authors only find this cell to be significant.
emo:    Measure of subjects' negative feeling during the experiment. A numeric scale ranging between 3 and 12 where 3 
           indicates the most negative feeling.
gender:  Subjects' gender

A complication that we will work around (kludge) for these interesting data is that the outcome variable here is
binary (not measured/continuous as we used in our examples). Switching over to appropriate logistic regression
methods would be best but since that would be slightly new material, I'll stick to linear models for proportions
or probabilities rather than the "correct" linear models for the logit.

Just for a check on obtaining the data, here is what I have with 265 subjects, 68 "treated"
> table(treat)
treat
  0   1 
197  68 
> dim(framing)
[1] 265  15

So here are the pieces of analysis you can obtain (among other summaries):
  fit emo ~ treat
  fit cong_mesg ~ emo by OLS even though binary outcome (logistic would be appropriate but here doesn't make much difference in fitted probabilities)
  fit cong_mesg ~ treat by OLS even though binary outcome, binary predictor--what OLS will give you is 
           "slope" Prob(cong_mesg =1|treat = 1) - Prob(cong_mesg =0|treat = 0) (change in outcome as treat moves from 0 to 1)
            "intercept" Prob(cong_mesg =0|treat = 0)

Questions:
 Is there a significant effect of treatment on emo?
 Is there a significant effect of treatment on cong_mesg?
 Estimate the effect on probability of sending congressional message of a unit change in "emo" (negative feelings). Compare the
 "path analysis" estimator (see week 3) for the encouragement design with the estimator you used in part 1. Why do the
 needed assumptions in this study seem far less reasonable than for the salt example?
 Repeat these questions just for the females in the study. Find anything different?

Problem 3
Multilevel Data, Random effects models
The data for this problem are  Exam obtained from the mlmRev package,
a collection of datasets that Doug Bates uses for illustrating
lme4 versus other computing (non-R) options.

These data were originally used in 
Goldstein, H., Rasbash, J., et al (1993). A multilevel analysis of school examination results.

Examples from Multilevel Software Comparative Reviews
Douglas Bates February 2005, with updates up to October 17, 2011
Abstract
The Center for Multilevel Modelling at the Institute of Education,
London maintains a web site of \Software reviews of multilevel mod-
eling packages". The data sets discussed in the reviews are available
at this web site. We have incorporated these data sets in the mlmRev
package for R and, in this vignette, provide the results of fitting 
several models to these data sets.

Section 2.1 of this vignette has discussion of the Exam data

-------------------------------
note: conveniently, this data set appears to provide schavg as the school mean of standLRT
(though you should verify that before using it)

--------------------------------------------------------

part 1. Multiple Levels of Analysis

Compute the traditional quantities for normexam predicted by the prior test score standLRT

a. aggregation bias, for using school means in place of individual data
b. contextual effect. (supposed) estimate of the effect on normexam for a student being in a school
   with one unit higher mean score on standLRT, student "held constant"

-----------------------------------------------------
part 2. Gender differences in outcome (the "gender gap") for the coed ("mixed" schools)

Pick off the mixed (i.e. coed) schools (i.e. schools that have both males and female students)
For reference, I used the type ("Mxd") indicator and get 35 schools, total of 2169 students (1110 males).

note: if I were doing this for real, I would likely question hard whether schools 47 and 43 are really
coed schools; why am I concerned?

Using the random effects models (lme, lmer) investigate gender differences in outcomes (normexam) 
for the coed schools

c. give a point estimate and standard error for gender differences in outcome for these multilevel data
d. do these gender differences have any association with "intake" (i.e. school mean on standLRT)?
In parts c and d
   Address with a formal statistical model. Write out the model clearly in Level 1, Level 2 format.
   Show your model estimation and results.
   Compare those results with Smart-first-year-student descriptive measures, including the relevant 
   graphics (scatterplot, boxplots)
----------------------------
NOTE 2/12. We made it to 3d before a serious wording problem arose. 
As noted on Assignments page Tuesday evening. There is a wording problem in Question 3,  part d.  
Where I say "do these gender differences have any association with "intake" (i.e. school mean on standLRT)?" 
I want you to use school mean on standLRT as the measure of intake. 
I regret not using the word input instead of intake in phrasing part d. 
There is justifiable confusion I created here, even though I tried to be explicit with the (i.e. ,,,) construction
